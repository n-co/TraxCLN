    Resize: use sero padding. might do according to image ration in order to preserve it.
    not all features will go on ram. we need to update our CPickle file and the way we extract feature arrays for training.
    we might also need to find a way not to hold all of our valid/test features on ram. but, all meta data is in ram.
    Aviv uses SGD optimizer.
    make sure evry epoch is suffled. i did and it was like that.


    change validation and test to be larger samples. using minibatches.c
